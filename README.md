A graph of co-authorship ties between academic organizations, based on papers to be presented at the [European Political Science Association](https://www.epsanet.org/) (EPSA) 2020 conference. The conference had to go remote due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so ties might not be representative of what was originally planned.

Almost every academic organization represented is an American or West European university. Isolated nodes (organizations represented only through single-authored papers) are not shown. Labelled nodes have a degree of 4+ in the (unweighted) graph.
