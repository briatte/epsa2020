A graph of co-authorship ties between academic organizations, based on papers to be presented at the [European Political Science Association](https://www.epsanet.org/) (EPSA) 2020 conference.

The conference had to go remote due to the Covid-19 pandemic, so ties might not be representative of what was originally planned.

Almost every academic organization represented is an American or West European university.
